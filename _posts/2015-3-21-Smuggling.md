title: Coffee Smuggling in Central America and Mexico
---

The flow of illicitly traded Central American coffee has reversed. Instead of Mexican and Honduran coffees being smuggled into Guatemala, Guatemalan and Honduran coffees are being smuggled into Mexico. The fundamentals underpinning this story tell us where Central American coffee is headed.

When bought or sold, coffee is quoted basis the “C” futures market[^fn-1] plus or minus some differential. In the past, Guatemalan differentials have been higher than Mexican differentials for similar qualities, hence the traditional flow of smuggled coffee from Mexico to Guatemala. This is no longer the case. Further, the “C” market has been depressed on growing global production. With low basis prices, farmers (an optimistic bunch) either wait for the market to rally or seek higher differentials. This pursuit of higher differentials drives illicit trade. 

[^fn-1]:  The “C” market is the coffee futures market for Arabica coffees and the backbone of the coffee world. This market, like other futures markets, was created by farmers as a means of hedging price fluctuations. It is traded on the ICE exchange in NYC.

Currently, Mexican differentials are higher than differentials of equivalent Central American coffee qualities by almost 10 cents per pound -- much lower than the cost of smuggling. These higher differentials come from roya, which devastated Mexican coffee production. Based on yields per hectare, we estimate this year’s harvest at around 2.5 million 69 kg bags (half the size of recent years). Supply of Mexican coffee is low and we still see some demand, despite the “substitutability” of many Mexican qualities: exporters who have already committed to selling Mexican coffee must buy and domestic Mexican consumption (for undergrades) is growing. Accordingly, differentials have climbed. 

Like any plague, roya hit some farms worse than others. While sophisticated farmers may have avoided roya and be enjoying the higher diffs with limited loss in their harvest, others are left with no coffee -- and they can’t get paid for coffee that they don’t have. So, the “little-guy” producers, unable to afford the cost of renovating damaged coffee plants, migrate to cities (American or Mexican). So, we have the low-grade producers leaving or switching to high-grades, and the high-grade producers staying. Additionally, exporters are realizing the market-insulating qualities that certified and specialty coffees have and, in some cases, providing the services necessary to move their suppliers in this direction. The end result is more certified, high-quality coffee and less conventional low-quality coffee. 

Whether this scenario has played out yet depends on the part of Mexico we look. In Tapachula, Chiapas, for example, the trend is in improving qualities. In the Altos de Chiapas region, however, the trend hasn't begun yet.

The smuggling of coffee into Mexico from countries like Guatemala and Honduras, who generally produced better coffee than Mexico, is a signal of Mexico’s shrinking, yet improving, market.
