title: "Coffee Smuggling into Mexico: Moving Towards Better Coffee"
---

Read time: 4 minutes

The flow of illicitly traded Central American coffee has reversed. Instead of Mexican and Honduran coffees being smuggled into Guatemala, Guatemalan and Honduran coffees are being smuggled into Mexico. The fundamentals underpinning this story tell us where Central American coffee is headed.

In the past, Guatemalan coffees have been more expensive than similar Mexican coffees, hence the traditional flow of smuggling from Mexico to Guatemala. This is no longer the case. Currently, Mexican coffees are more expensive than similar Central American qualities by almost 10 cents per pound -- much less than the cost of smuggling. These higher prices come from drastic reductions in Mexican supply, due to the coffee rust fungus that desvastated Mexican producers. Based on yields per hectare, this year’s harvest is estimated at around 2.45 million 69 kg bags: half the size of recent years. 

Coffee rust hit some farmers worse than others. Sophisticated farmers may have avoided coffee rust altogether and be enjoying the higher diffs with limited loss in their harvest. Others may be left with no coffee -- and they can’t get paid for coffee that they don’t have, leaving them unable to renovate their farms. So, the “little guy” either migrate to cities (American or Mexican) or receive a helping hand from bigger coffee corporations seeking to establish a better supply chain. These corporations may, for example, sell producers higher quality, rust-resistant plants in exchange for the promise of future coffee. Or, they may help farmers through the certification process, thereby providing some degree of insulation from market forces (more on this later).

With the low grade producers leaving or switching to higher grades, and the high grade producers relatively unharmed, the quality of Mexican coffee will gradually increase. In some parts of the countries, these changes have already happened (ex.: Talquian, Chiapas). Other parts are slower to react (ex.: the Chamula region, also in Chiapas). 

Mexico is not unique in this respect. Farmers in other countries will slowly recognize the benefits of improved quality and certifications. It may take some amount of market disruption, as was the case in Mexico. But if we can bet on anything in coffee, it is that market disruption will come. Further, due to (some extent of) aligned interests, those with the available resources (i.e. large trading houses) will aid farmers in this transition. 

It should be mentioned that all of these changes are coming from the growing demand for higher quality coffees. So let's keep on supporting high quality farmers by paying up for our favorite specialty coffees, and thereby providing positive examples for other farmers.

Underlying the smuggling of coffee into Mexico from countries like Guatemala and Honduras, who generally produced better coffee than Mexico, are fundamentals that signal a transition to higher quality coffees. These changes, I expect, will continue to take place in other coffee-producing regions as they are struck with "survival of the fittest" scenarios, in which the fittest are those with some degree of market insulation (high quality and certified producers.
